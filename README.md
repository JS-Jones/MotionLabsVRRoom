# Motion Labs VR Gamification Project

## What the Project Does

The Motion Labs VR Gamification Project leverages a unique integration of VR, motion capture, force plate treadmills, and EEGs (electroencephalograms) to enhance rehabilitation practices for patients. This VR program creates an interactive and engaging experience, allowing patients to participate in gamified exercises that promote movement and recovery in an enjoyable way. The system provides live biofeedback from EEG data to help users and clinicians understand brain activity patterns during the rehabilitation process, which supports better engagement and tracking of progress.

## Why the Project is Useful

This project addresses several key challenges in physical rehabilitation:
- **Enhanced Patient Engagement**: By gamifying the rehabilitation process, patients are more likely to remain engaged and motivated in their exercises.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Clinicians receive real-time EEG biofeedback, offering insights into patients' brain activity and physical responses during therapy sessions. This aids in adjusting treatment plans based on measurable neurological and physical data.
- **Personalized Rehabilitation**: By working closely with over 20 clinicians and therapists, the project ensures that each VR exercise and interaction aligns with therapeutic goals, making rehabilitation both effective and patient-centered.

## Getting Started:
The code is built to work with VICON motion capture and BERTEC treadmill. The game will not run on your end without proper equipment, but the unity project may still be accessible.

To get started with the Motion Labs VR Gamification Project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/motion-labs-vr-gamification.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate into the project folder and install required dependencies. Ensure you have Unity, any motion capture drivers, and EEG software integrated with the system.
    ```bash
    cd motion-labs-vr-gamification
    # Follow the setup instructions for your specific hardware/software configuration
    ```

3. **Run the Program**: Launch the Unity project, connect your motion capture and EEG devices, and initiate the VR program to begin a session.
